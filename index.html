                <p>The Cats appeared to have let this one get away as they led by as many as 20 in the second quarter and let the Wizards come all the way back to take their first lead with 5:28 left in the fourth. Both teams traded buckets for the rest of the quarter, forcing the game into overtime tied, 87-87. Kemba Walker drilled the only field goal in the extra session a - deep, 30-foot three-pointer to give the Cats an early lead. That's all they would need as Charlotte sealed the game with clutch free throws from Walker and Al Jefferson, outscoring Washington 7-1 in OT.</p>
